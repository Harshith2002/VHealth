                        <li>Roll your shoulders back and straighten your arms roughly parallel to the floor with your palms turned up. Do your best to balance on the sit bones, but it's normal if you are resting slightly behind them. Focus on lifting your chest to support the balance. </li>
                        <li>Stay for at least five breaths. Release your legs on an exhale. Then inhale and sit up. </li>
